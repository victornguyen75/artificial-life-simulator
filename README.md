# Artificial Life Simulator

This repo is a copy of [hunar4321's particle-life simulation](https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life). This is a JavaScript program that simulates life by setting rules of attraction of repulsion among the atoms.

This simulation uses the laws of physics and math:

- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Newton's 2nd Law
- Pythagorean Theorem
